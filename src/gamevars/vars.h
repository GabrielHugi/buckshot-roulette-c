  2 - Adrenaline, lets you steal sum shit
  3 - Cigarette pack, heals 1 hp
  4 - Expired medicine, 50% heals 2 hp, 50% lose 1 hp
  5 - Hand saw, makes gun do 2x damage, on revolver it will make it have a 50% chance of missing the shot
  6 - Handcuffs & Jammer, opponent doesn't play next round
  7 - Inverter, inverts round
  8 - Magnifying glass, sees current round
  additions for extended mode
  9 - Rusty handgun, 50% chance to hit him for 1 hp, 50% change explode on you for 1 hp (Is an item not a main weapon, you still have the turn regardless of outcome)
  a (in ascii) - Body armor, tanks up 1 hp on the next hit but the next hit has to come in the immediate next round, otherwise the armor breaks cuz its old and shit
  b - Running shoes, lets you attempt to run away with wathever money you already have, 70% chance of failure
  c - Coffe, racks a random number of shells between 1 and 4 with the chance for 2 shells being 2/5, the rest having evenly distributed chances 
  additions for sigma mode
   - Mogging, makes your opponent look ugly and takes 1 hp from him, but there is a 20% chance that you will be the one considered ugly and your self steem will be obliterated for 2 points
